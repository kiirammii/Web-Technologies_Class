        <h2>5 MYTHS ABOUT BOOKING A FLIGHT THAT YOU NEED TO IGNORE</h2>

        <p>Let's talk about cheap flights. We all know airlines are out to screw us over<br>
            — and no one wants to be the person who gets stuck paying the highest<br>
            fare. That's why we spend hours upon hours researching articles on airfare,<br>
            trying to game the system like we're attempting to outsmart a used car<br>
            salesman.
        </p>
        
        <p><a style="color: #3D89AE;" href="" target="_blank">I've written about finding a cheap flight before</a> — and even <a style="color: #3D89AE;" href="" target="_blank">my process<br>
            for booking a flight</a> — but today I want to talk about some persistent and<br>
            inaccurate myths about booking a flight that have stuck around through<br>
            simple inertia and lazy journalism.
